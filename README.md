# SocketIO-Chat-App

A simple chat app built using Node js, Express and SocketIO.

Users can:
1) Create new chat rooms. New chat rooms will be automatically assigned a 6 character alphanumeric string for their chat room.
2) Connect to existing chat rooms by going to the URL followed by the 6 digit string for that room.
