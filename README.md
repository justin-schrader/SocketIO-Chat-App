# SocketIO-Chat-App

A simple chat app built using Node js, Express and SocketIO.

Users can:
1) Create new chat rooms. New chat rooms will be automatically assigned a 6 character alphanumeric string for their chat room.
2) Connect to existing chat rooms by going to the URL followed by the 6 digit string for that room.

Once connected, they will be able to see all messages sent within that room, as well as an up-to-date list of anyone currently
connected to that room.
